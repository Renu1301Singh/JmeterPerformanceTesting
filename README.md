# Introduction to Performance Testing

Performance testing using JMeter involves assessing the performance and scalability of web applications, 
APIs, and servers under various load conditions. JMeter offers a range of components that aid in 
creating realistic test scenarios, executing tests, and analyzing results. 



## Tasks Performed  Are:

> Task 1: Create a basic Test Plan and describe the purpose of each component added.
> Objective: Familiarize yourself with the JMeter GUI. Explore elements like Test Plan, Thread Group, Samplers, Listeners, etc.

> Task 2: Record a simple browsing scenario on a demo website (e.g., navigating through pages) using the HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder and run the test.
> Objective: Understand how to test a web application.

> Task 3: Create a test that logs into a demo web application using multiple user credentials stored in a CSV file.
> Objective: Learn how to use external data for testing.

> Task 4: Add assertions to a test plan to validate the presence of specific texts in the response of a web request.
> Objective: Grasp how to verify the correctness of a response.

> Task 5: Insert a Constant Timer to add a delay between requests in a test plan and observe the impact on the load test results.
> Objective: Understand the use of timers to simulate real user think time

> Task 6: Design a load test plan for a web page with increasing users (thread) over time and analyze the results.
> Objective: Understand the basics of load testing.

> Task 7: Run a test and use different Listeners (e.g., View Results Tree, Aggregate Report) to analyze and interpret the data collected during the test.
> Objective: Learn to interpret test results for better insights.
